# Fast-Good-Cheap
I participated in an afternoon hacking challenge with two teammates during which we were challenged to create a model that predicted salary information based on 1994 US Census Data. We were were only allowed to use 3 features to build out our model.  After 4 hours, we built out an XGBoost model that received an 84% accuracy score when mapped on the withheld test data.
